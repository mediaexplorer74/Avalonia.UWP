# AvaloniaUWP

Experimental UWP implementation for Avalonia. 


## About

I forked this [https://github.com/pingzing/avalonia-uwp-fork](avalonia-uwp-fork) project.

This is draft only. UWP Library seems to be not completed. No samples... so.. sorry. As is.

## 2 super-crazy ideas from [m][e] 

- "Avalonia Engine"-based XBOX UWP apps
- "Avalonia Engine"-based ARM64 UWP apps, hehe (not for W10M... but... who knows if you get early builds of Avaloniaui 0.5...)

## Words of the author

"I'm looking to build a cross-platform GUI host and had the crazy idea of using assemblies of Avalonia XAML and codebehind be the meat-and-potatoes of the framework, but started thinking about how to get such a framework into the Microsoft Store. Could UWP host an app that renders Avalonia XAML? Then I found this. I haven't had time to work with it yet, but I'm curious if you have any documentation on what led you to do this and any follow up plans or articles?"
